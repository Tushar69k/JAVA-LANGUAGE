/*
Constructors are Special Member Function which are called when an Object is Created .
They are used to Initialise values to Data Members of Objects.

Types Of Constructor :-
1. Default / Non-Parameterised Constructor
2. Parameterised Constructor
3. Copy Constructor

1. Default / Non-Parameterised Constructor :-
        These do not require any Parameter and uses Default values to initialise object
        and can be created Implicitly by the Compiler Itself if no Default Constructor
        is Given to it.

2. Parameterised Constructor
        These Constructors uses Argument to Initialise Values to Data Members of object.
        We can Give different types of Parameter to the Constructors and this overloading
        of Constructors is known as Constructor Overloading.
        ( This is known as Polymorphism )

3. Copy Constructor
        These are used to Copy Data Members of one Object to Another Object.


Java Garbage Collectors are used to Free up Memory at Runtime
This Concept is not in C++ , Hence we Create Destructors There
